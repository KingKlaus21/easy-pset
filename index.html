            <li>Presented with recordings of a pair of people of the same sex speaking the same
                phrase, can a listener determine which speaker is taller simply from the sound of
                their voice? Twenty-four young adults at Washington University listened to 100
                pairs of speakers and, within each pair, were asked to indicate which of the two
                speakers was the taller. Here are the number correct (out of 100) for each of the 24
                participants.</li>

            <img>

            <p>Researchers believe that the key to correct discrimination is contained in a
                particular type of sound produced in the lungs, whose frequency is lower for taller
                people.</p>

                <li>If the experimental subjects are just guessing which speaker is taller, they
                    should correctly identify the taller person about 50% of the time. Does this
                    data support the researchers’ conjecture that there is information in a
                    person’s voice to help identify the taller person? Why or why not?</li>

            <li>A social (or service) robot is designed to entertain, educate, and care for human
                users. In a paper published by International Conference on Social Robotics (Vol. 6414,
                2010), design engineers investigated the trend in the design of social robots. Using a
                random sample of 106 social robots obtained during a Web search, the engineers found
                that 63 were built with legs only, 20 with wheels only, 8 with both legs and wheels and
                15 with neither legs nor wheels. This information is displayed in the graph below.</li>
